# 🧠 Deep-Learning-based-models-for-Fashion-Apparel-Classification
This repository contains three deep learning-based image classification models — **ResNet152V2**, **DenseNet201**, and **MobileNetV3** — trained and fine-tuned to classify different categories of fashion apparels. The aim of this project is to assist fashion-related applications in automating apparel categorization for tasks like product tagging, visual search, and personalized recommendations.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- ✅ Fine-tuned **ResNet152V2**:  
  - **Training Accuracy**: 96.31%  
  - **Test Accuracy**: 87.96%

- ✅ Fine-tuned **DenseNet201**:  
  - **Training Accuracy**: 98.07%  
  - **Test Accuracy**: 95.83%

- ✅ Fine-tuned **MobileNetV3**:  
  - **Training Accuracy**: 86.12%  
  - **Test Accuracy**: 91.67%

> Transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques were used to optimize each model for better generalization and accuracy on a custom fashion apparel dataset.
